# 🌿 B3tter Market Intelligence
### A Data-Driven Sentiment & Competitive Analysis of the Healthy Snack Market in Spain

> **Disclaimer:** This is an independent, unsolicited project. I have no affiliation with B3tter. All data used is publicly available.

---

## 📌 Motivation

B3tter is one of the most interesting healthy food brands in the Spanish market — not just because of their products, but because of how they've built their brand around a lifestyle and a community. As a data scientist and ML engineer with a strong interest in health, nutrition, and endurance sports, I wanted to go beyond applying to companies with a CV and instead **show what I can do with their own data**.

This project applies NLP, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to publicly available customer reviews to answer concrete business questions about B3tter's product perception, competitive positioning, and brand differentiation.

## 🎯 Business Hypotheses

The analysis is structured around six hypotheses:

| # | Hypothesis |
|---|-----------|
| H1 | Flavor is the primary satisfaction driver for granolas; satiety for bars; Nutella comparison for the cocoa cream |
| H2 | Negative reviews concentrate on price and quantity per pack, not product quality |
| H3 | B3tter customers mention lifestyle attributes (health, sport, clean ingredients) more than competitors' customers, who focus on macros |
| H4 | B3tter has higher average sentiment than Paleobull and Nakd but lower review volume, suggesting a consolidated but less-penetrated brand |
| H5 | Bundle and pack reviews have higher average ratings than individual products, indicating the bundle format drives loyalty |
| H6 | B3tter has a higher proportion of reviews and mentions referencing community and lifestyle vs pure product, consistent with a founder-led content marketing strategy |
